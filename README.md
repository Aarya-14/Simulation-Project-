# Simulated Lattice Energy Minimization Using Lennard-Jones Potential
Designed and implemented a Python-based simulation to analyze interatomic interactions in an FCC crystal using the Lennard-Jones potential with periodic boundary conditions. Generated the FCC lattice for varying parameters, calculated potential energy within a defined cutoff radius, and plotted energy-distance curves to identify equilibrium distance, lattice parameter, and minimum energy. Applied NumPy for efficient computations and Matplotlib for visualization.
